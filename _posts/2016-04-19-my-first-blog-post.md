title: My First Blog Post!
---

This is my first blog post. I have nothing much to say, really. But man-oh-man is this website/blog ever *smexy!*

Also, here's some `code`...
{% highlight java %}
public class Hopding {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hopding!"); //This is a somewhat lengthy comment explaining that this line of code prints "Hopding!" to STDOUT
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
