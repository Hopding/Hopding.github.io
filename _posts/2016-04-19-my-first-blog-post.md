title: My First Blog Post!
---

This is a substantially lengthy sentence that I'm going to use to see just how far I can get the text to stretch to the right of the screen.

This is my first blog post. I have nothing much to say, really. But man-oh-man is this website/blog ever *supa-cool!*

Also, here's some `code`...

```java
public class Hopding {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hopding!"); //This is a somewhat lengthy comment explaining that this line of code prints "Hopding!" to STDOUT
  }
}
```

But, we can, of course, do the exact same thing in `Python`. Only difference is, the `Python` code is MUCH more succinct:

```python
print('Hopding!') #Ver 3.x,
                  #This is a somewhat lengthy comment explaining that this line of code prints "Hopding!" to STDOUT
```
