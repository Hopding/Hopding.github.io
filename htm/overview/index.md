title: HTM Overview
---
_**Layers**_ are the main unit of structure and function in HTM theory. Layers are made up of columns of cells. These columns of cells are responsible for recognizing and storing spatial and temporal patterns in incoming data. They are also the only structure found inside a layer.

These columns of cells don't do much by themselves - but, they are operated upon by two algorithms: the _**Spatial Pooler**_ and the _**Temporal Memory**_. These two algorithms are responsible for most of a layer's complexity. So, the structure of a layer is relatively simple, but the function of a layer is relatively complex.

I've written two additional pages explaining in more detail the structure of the columns of cells, and the function of the Spatial Pooler and Temporal Memory:

* Structure of Columns & Spatial Pooler Function
* Structure of Cells & Temporal Memory Function
