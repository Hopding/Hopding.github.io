### About This Blog

This website is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you are so
inclined, you can access the site's repository [here](https://github.com/Hopding/Hopding.github.io).

I've chosen to name my blog Hopding because it's a snappy, funny name. I've employed Hopding as a
username for a number of purposes since age 8, and the domain `hopding.com` was available for purchase.
It also has a woody sort of sound to it, not tinny at all[^1].

### Footnotes
[^0]: Which, when acronymized is SQUAT - sort of amusing...
[^1]: +1 if you understood that reference!
