### About Me

My name is Andrew Dillon. I am a resident of St. Louis, Missouri. I'm currently studying Computer Science as an undergraduate. I work as a Software Tester. I enjoy writing software, thinking about the future, and learning about machine learning/AI in my spare time. I am fascinated by [HTM theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_temporal_memory) in particular, and have contributed to the [HTM.Java project](https://github.com/numenta/htm.java/blob/master/README.md).

### About This Blog

This website is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you are so
inclined, you can access the site's repository [here](https://github.com/Hopding/Hopding.github.io).

I've chosen to name my blog Hopding because it's a snappy, funny name. I've employed Hopding as a
username for a number of purposes since age 8, and the domain `hopding.com` was happily available for purchase.
It also has a woody sort of sound to it, not tinny at all[^1].
